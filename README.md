`texted.py` is a Python program designed for encryption and decryption of text using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what it does and how to use it:

### Functionality Overview:

1. **Key Management:**
   - `generate_key()`: Generates a new random 256-bit (32-byte) key for AES encryption.
   - `save_key(key)`: Stores the generated key in a JSON file (`key.json`), encoded in base64 format.
   - `load_key()`: Loads the AES key from `key.json`. If `key.json` doesn't exist, it generates and saves a new key.

2. **Key Export/Import:**
   - `export_key(file_path)`: Copies the current AES key from `key.json` to a specified file.
   - `import_key(file_path)`: Imports an AES key from a specified file into `key.json`.

3. **Text Padding:**
   - `pad_text(text)`: Pads the input text to make its length a multiple of the AES block size using PKCS7 padding.
   - `unpad_text(padded_text)`: Removes PKCS7 padding from decrypted text.

4. **Encryption/Decryption:**
   - `encrypt_text(text, key)`: Encrypts plaintext using AES in CBC mode with a random IV (Initialization Vector).
   - `decrypt_text(encrypted_text, key)`: Decrypts ciphertext encrypted with AES in CBC mode using the provided key and IV.

5. **Main Program (`main()` function):**
   - Displays a menu-driven interface to perform operations:
     - Encrypt text
     - Decrypt text
     - Export key to a file
     - Import key from a file
     - Exit the program

### How to Use `texted.py` in Termux (Android):

To use `texted.py` in Termux on Android, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python in Termux:**
   - If Python isn't already installed, install it using:
     ```
     pkg install python
     ```

2. **Prepare the Script:**
   - Copy the `texted.py` script into your Termux environment. You can do this via various methods like downloading directly on your device or using `curl`.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Navigate to the directory where `texted.py` is located using Termux's `cd` command.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```
     python texted.py
     ```

4. **Follow the Menu:**
   - Once the script is running, follow the on-screen menu options:
     - Choose options by entering the corresponding number and following the prompts.
     - Encrypt and decrypt text as needed. Make sure to handle the AES key carefully, especially if exporting or importing it.

5. **Exiting:**
   - Select option `5` to exit the program when you're done.

### Notes:
- Ensure you handle the AES key (`key.json`) securely. Losing this file means losing the ability to decrypt previously encrypted data.
- Always exercise caution with sensitive information and encryption keys, especially on shared or mobile devices.

By following these steps, you can effectively use `texted.py` in Termux for text encryption and decryption tasks on your Android device.
